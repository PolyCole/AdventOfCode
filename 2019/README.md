# AdventOfCode2019
My solutions to the 2019 Advent of Code event.

Advent of Code is a code-inspired Advent Calendar created by Eric Wastl.

If you're interested in participating, you can check out more information [here](https://adventofcode.com/2019/about)

Additionally, if you would like to compete against me, I've created a private leaderboard with code `333544-e0f40b57`

Happy coding and Happy Holidays!
